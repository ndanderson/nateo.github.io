As of now, I am a Lead Application Engineer @SPSCommerce Located in Minneapolis. Over the course of my career I have helped manage and build many complex ~~[[hrydas::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra]]~~ scalable systems. I like the cloud, and dislike incidents. 

When not working, I help organize our local DevOps Meetup along with DevOps Days Minneapolis. The tech culture here in Minneapolis is special, and it is an honor being able to leave my small mark. Interested in attending a meeting, check out our [[Meetup::https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Minneapolis/]] page.

I have developed interest in many things including space, flight, renewable energy, beer, and biking.
