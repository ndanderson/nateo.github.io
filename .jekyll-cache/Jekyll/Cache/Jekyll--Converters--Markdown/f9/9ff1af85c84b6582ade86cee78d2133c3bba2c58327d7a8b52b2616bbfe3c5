I"+<p>As of now, I am a Lead Application Engineer @SPSCommerce Located in Mineapolis. Over the course of my career I have helped manage and build many complex <del>[[hrydas::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(genus)]]</del> scalable systems. I like the cloud, and dislike incidents. I wear my pager like a badge of honor!</p>

<p>When not working, I have developed interest in many things including cognitive science, mathematics, and philosophy; and my personal penchant is to one day create a software system that I call the CogShell (Short for the  Cognitive Shell[[See my writeup on it: <a href="/posts/cogshell">here</a>::rsn]]): A highly interconnnected software toolkit with all the essential tools to support thought continuity through tacit object permanance.</p>

<blockquote class="boxit">
  <p>The design of the website is inspired by multiple sources with the intention of making the website more functional. Having said that, I am not a skilled front-end developer/UI-developer, so I could only come somewhat closer to my inital design that I sketched <em>(see left or click on this ⊕ icon beside the question above if you are on a mobile device)</em>, hopefully this will clear why it's structured the way it is. In fact, I had to remove the lab option because of my current inability to design it. That said, I can also safely say that I am improving based on the initial iterations of the website that can be seen here: [[Jan-22-2020::https://web.archive.org/web/20200122164405/raghuveer.net]], [[Apr-13-2020::https://web.archive.org/web/20200413193808/raghuveer.net]], [[Apr-20-2020::https://web.archive.org/web/20200420172058/raghuveer.net]]</p>
